# Offline voice chat project
[Proof of concept in python]

## TODO list
- Use TTS directly from python
- Add feature to detect the chat (like "OK Google !")
- Detect the end of chat

## Target
1. Start simple command or service
2. With the voice, start the transcription
3. Push the transcription in gpt4all (offline GPT)
4. Read the gtp4all's answer by generated voice

## Tools

- [GPT4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all)
- [Mozilla TTS](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS)
